## üå± Project Overview
The **Smart Plant Disease Detector** is a web-based application built using Flask and TensorFlow that allows users to upload an image of a plant leaf and get predictions about potential diseases affecting the plant. The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a dataset of various plant diseases to classify images into specific categories.

This project aims to assist farmers, researchers, and enthusiasts in identifying plant diseases early, enabling timely intervention and improving crop health.
